Debouncing
is a technique that delays the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. This can be useful for preventing unnecessary function calls, such as when a user is typing in a search box and you want to wait until they have finished typing before making a search request.

Throttling
is a technique that limits the number of times a function can be called within a certain period of time. This can be useful for preventing functions from being called too often, which can cause performance problems.
